Hi I am Akash Verma, Building an app for desaster managment(especially for flood).

Features of the app:
  1. Locate yourself on google Map and share your location among your family and friends to tell them your conditions.
  2. A built-in walkie - talkie so that you can call for help anyone nearby you connected with the app.(network can be a problem)

This app contains several activities :

1.This app needs to sign in which provide you a unique ID which can be directly handled by main server (or government/ saving Team).which can access your location and guide you toward a safe place.
2. Main menu is classified for two groups- one is in saving and other is in suffering.
    (Saver)If someone want to help( he can be a saved one in desaster
    (sufferer) Person needs help in term of life saving , basic needs or shelter.
    
    If saver and sufferer successfully met then he will assigned as safe.
